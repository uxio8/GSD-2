## UNIT: Plan Milestone {{milestoneId}} ("{{milestoneTitle}}")

All relevant context has been preloaded below — start working immediately without re-reading these files.

{{inlinedContext}}

Narrate your slice-ordering reasoning — what you're proving first, where the real risk is, and why each slice boundary is where it is.

Then:
1. Read the template at `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/roadmap.md`
2. Read `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` if it exists. Treat **Active** requirements as the capability contract for planning. If it does not exist, continue in legacy compatibility mode but explicitly note that requirement coverage is operating without a contract.
3. If a `GSD Skill Preferences` block is present in system context, use it to decide which skills to load and follow during planning, without overriding required roadmap formatting
4. Create the roadmap: decompose into demoable vertical slices — as many as the work genuinely needs, no more. A simple feature might be 1 slice. Don't decompose for decomposition's sake.
5. Order by risk (high-risk first)
6. Write `{{outputPath}}` with checkboxes, risk, depends, demo sentences, proof strategy, verification classes, milestone definition of done, **requirement coverage**, and a boundary map. Write success criteria as observable truths, not implementation tasks. If the milestone crosses multiple runtime boundaries, include an explicit final integration slice that proves the assembled system works end-to-end in a real environment
7. If planning produced structural decisions (e.g. slice ordering rationale, technology choices, scope exclusions), append them to `.gsd/DECISIONS.md` (read the template at `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/decisions.md` if the file doesn't exist yet)
8. Update `.gsd/STATE.md`

## Requirement Mapping Rules

- Every Active requirement relevant to this milestone must be in one of these states by the end of planning: mapped to a slice, explicitly deferred, blocked with reason, or moved out of scope.
- Each requirement should have one accountable primary owner and may have supporting slices.
- Product-facing milestones should cover launchability, primary user loop, continuity, and failure visibility when relevant.
- A slice may support multiple requirements, but should not exist with no requirement justification unless it is clearly enabling work for a mapped requirement.
- Include a compact coverage summary in the roadmap so omissions are mechanically visible.
- If `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` exists and an Active requirement has no credible path, surface that clearly. Do not silently ignore orphaned Active requirements.

## Planning Doctrine

Apply these when decomposing and ordering slices:

- **Risk-first means proof-first.** The earliest slices should prove the hardest thing works by shipping the real feature through the uncertain path. If auth is the risk, the first slice ships a real login page with real session handling that a user can actually use — not a CLI command that returns "authenticated: true". Proof is the shipped feature working. There is no separate "proof" artifact. Do not plan spikes, proof-of-concept slices, or validation-only slices — the proof is the real feature, built through the risky path.
- **Every slice is vertical, demoable, and shippable.** Every slice ships real, user-facing functionality. "Demoable" means you could show a stakeholder and they'd see real product progress — not a developer showing a terminal command. If the only way to demonstrate the slice is through a test runner or a curl command, the slice is missing its UI/UX surface. Add it. A slice that only proves something but doesn't ship real working code is not a slice — restructure it.
- **Brownfield bias.** When planning against an existing codebase, ground slices in existing modules, conventions, and seams. Prefer extending real patterns over inventing new ones.
- **Each slice should establish something downstream slices can depend on.** Think about what stable surface this slice creates for later work — an API, a data shape, a proven integration path.
- **Avoid foundation-only slices.** If a slice doesn't produce something demoable end-to-end, it's probably a layer, not a vertical slice. Restructure it.
- **Verification-first.** When planning slices, know what "done" looks like before detailing implementation. Each slice's demo line should describe concrete, verifiable evidence — not vague "it works" claims.
- **Plan for integrated reality, not just local proof.** Distinguish contract proof from live integration proof. If the milestone involves multiple runtime boundaries, one slice must explicitly prove the assembled system through the real entrypoint or runtime path.
- **Truthful demo lines only.** If a slice is proven by fixtures or tests only, say so. Do not phrase harness-level proof as if the user can already perform the live end-to-end behavior unless that has actually been exercised.
- **Completion must imply capability.** If every slice in this roadmap were completed exactly as written, the milestone's promised outcome should actually work at the proof level claimed. Do not write slices that can all be checked off while the user-visible capability still does not exist.
- **Don't invent risks.** If the project is straightforward, skip the proof strategy and just ship value in smart order. Not everything has major unknowns.
- **Ship features, not proofs.** A completed slice should leave the product in a state where the new capability is actually usable through its real interface. A login flow slice ends with a working login page, not a middleware function. An API slice ends with endpoints that return real data from a real store, not hardcoded fixtures. A dashboard slice ends with a real dashboard rendering real data, not a component that renders mock props. If a slice can't ship the real thing yet because a dependency isn't built, it should ship with realistic stubs that are clearly marked for replacement — but the user-facing surface must be real.
- **Ambition matches the milestone.** The number and depth of slices should match the milestone's ambition. A milestone promising "core platform with auth, data model, and primary user loop" should have enough slices to actually deliver all three as working features — not two proof-of-concept slices and a note that "the rest will come in the next milestone." If the milestone's context promises an outcome, the roadmap must deliver it.
- **Right-size the decomposition.** Match slice count to actual complexity. If the work is small enough to build and verify in one pass, it's one slice. Conversely, don't cram genuinely independent capabilities into one slice just to keep the count low.

## Single-Slice Fast Path

If the roadmap has only one slice, also write the slice plan and task plans inline during this unit instead of waiting for a separate planning session.

1. Read the templates:
   - `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/plan.md`
   - `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/task-plan.md`
2. `mkdir -p {{milestonePath}}/slices/S01/tasks`
3. Write the S01 plan file at `{{milestonePath}}/slices/S01/S01-PLAN.md`
4. Write individual task plans at `{{milestonePath}}/slices/S01/tasks/T01-PLAN.md`, etc.
5. For simple slices, keep the plan lean. Omit `Proof Level`, `Integration Closure`, and `Observability / Diagnostics` when they would all be trivial or empty.

**You MUST write the file `{{outputAbsPath}}` before finishing.**

When done, say: "Milestone {{milestoneId}} planned."
