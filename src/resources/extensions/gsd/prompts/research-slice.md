## UNIT: Research Slice {{sliceId}} ("{{sliceTitle}}") — Milestone {{milestoneId}}

All relevant context has been preloaded below — start working immediately without re-reading these files.

### Dependency Slice Summaries

Pay particular attention to **Forward Intelligence** sections — they contain hard-won knowledge about what's fragile, what assumptions changed, and what to watch out for.

{{dependencySummaries}}

Narrate the important findings as they emerge — what changed your view of the slice, what risks look real, and what should shape the next phase.

Then research what this slice needs:
0. If `REQUIREMENTS.md` was preloaded above, identify which Active requirements this slice owns or supports. Research should target these requirements — surfacing risks, unknowns, and implementation constraints that could affect whether the slice actually delivers them.
1. If a `GSD Skill Preferences` block is present in system context, use it to decide which skills to load and follow during research, without relaxing required verification or artifact rules
2. **Skill Discovery ({{skillDiscoveryMode}}):**{{skillDiscoveryInstructions}}
3. Explore relevant code for this slice's scope. For targeted exploration, use `rg`, `find`, and reads. For broad or unfamiliar subsystems, use `scout` to map the relevant area first.
4. Use `resolve_library` / `get_library_docs` for unfamiliar libraries
5. Read the template at `~/.gsd/agent/extensions/gsd/templates/research.md`
6. Write `{{outputPath}}`

The slice directory already exists at `{{slicePath}}/`. Do NOT mkdir — just write the file.

**You MUST write the file `{{outputAbsPath}}` before finishing.**

When done, say: "Slice {{sliceId}} researched."
